# Bundled webfonts

Most font files in this directory are licensed under the
**SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1** (OFL-1.1), which permits bundling
and redistribution with this project. Full text: <https://openfontlicense.org/>

**Two families are not OFL — see “Thmanyah” below before reusing anything here.**

All OFL families are sourced from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
Only the `arabic` and `latin` unicode subsets are bundled, at the weights
declared in the stylesheets.

## Two stylesheets, one declaration each

| Sheet | Loaded | Families |
|---|---|---|
| `garden-core.css` | on every page, imported by `shared/garden.css` | the site's own faces |
| `garden-fonts.css` | injected only when a reader opens the appearance dialog | the reading-font library |

A family is declared in exactly one of the two. Declaring it twice would let
the later sheet win and silently narrow its weight range.

Declaring a face does not download it: the browser fetches a file only when a
glyph actually needs it. Picking a font from the library costs one request.

## Variable files

Most families ship as a **single variable file per subset** covering their whole
weight range (`font-weight: 400 700` and similar). Google Fonts returns the same
file for every weight of a variable family, so storing one weight per file would
ship identical bytes under different names. Only Amiri, Spectral and Zain are
static, and they ship two weights each.

The Arabic library files carry the `arabic` subset only. Latin characters inside
an Arabic page — course codes, digits — fall through to Cairo, the site face,
which is already loaded. That keeps them identical whichever reading font is
chosen, and halves the download.
